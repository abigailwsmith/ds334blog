    "text": "Introduction\nGroundhog day is an amusing American tradition celebrated on February 2nd, in which a groundhog either sees its shadow, meaning winter will extend 6 more weeks, or it doesn’t, meaning Spring will arrive early. The tradition is said to have originated from German-Americans and is especially popular in Pennsylvania, as there is a high German-American population there.\nI think that it will be fun and interesting to look at data gathered from these celebrations, which is why for my first blog post I chose to work with the groundhog dataset from the TidyTuesday Repo on GitHub. The dataset is made up of two individual dataframes, entitled “groundhogs” and “predictions”. The “groundhogs” data provides information about the groundhogs’ names, states, and various other variables. The “predictions” dataset provides information about the predictions made by the groundhogs, measured in the shadow variable, these predictions have been gathered between 1887 and 2023. Additionally, I used the state_df which provides geographic information on different US states, such as their latitude and longitude. This will be useful to make a map.\nI will need to join the two groundhog dataframes into one big datafrane using their id numbers. In this full dataset I am interested in looking at the shadow and region variables.\n\n\nQuestion of interest\nIs there a clear trend in predictions based on region? To be specific, are shadow sightings more common in Northern areas where it is more common to have longer winters in general?\n\n\nData set links\nGroundhogs: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/66f1fa48a2c09131e5500a7bf12201c6581f28fa/data/2024/2024-01-30/groundhogs.csv &\nPredictions: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/66f1fa48a2c09131e5500a7bf12201c6581f28fa/data/2024/2024-01-30/predictions.csv).\nState_df: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/maps.pdf\n\n\nRead in the data and packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(here)\nstate_df &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(\"state\")\ngroundhogs &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/groundhogs.csv\"))\npredictions &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/predictions.csv\"))\n\n\n\nTidying, wrangling, and joining the data\nFirst I had to join the “groundhogs” and “predictions” datasets to combine the two into one dataset which will have information about the groundhogs as well as their predictions.\n\ngroundhogs_pred &lt;- left_join(groundhogs, predictions, by = \"id\")\ngroundhogs_pred\n\n# A tibble: 1,462 × 20\n      id slug     shortname name  city  region country latitude longitude source\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 2     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 3     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 4     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 5     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 6     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 7     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 8     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n 9     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n10     1 punxsut… Phil      Punx… Punx… Penns… USA         40.9     -79.0 https…\n# ℹ 1,452 more rows\n# ℹ 10 more variables: current_prediction &lt;chr&gt;, is_groundhog &lt;lgl&gt;,\n#   type &lt;chr&gt;, active &lt;lgl&gt;, description &lt;chr&gt;, image &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   predictions_count &lt;dbl&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;, shadow &lt;lgl&gt;, details &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThe “groundhogs_pred” dataset has some groundhogs in Canada in addition to the US. For the purpose of my investigation, I only want to look at groundhogs in the US so I filtered the dataset to only include those. Some of the earlier groundhog days in the dataset do not have anything recorded for the shadow variable so I filtered out those NA cases. Lastly, I changed the names of the states in the region variable to lowercase so that they would match the names in the state_df.\n\ngroundhogs_pred &lt;- groundhogs_pred |&gt; filter(country == \"USA\") |&gt; filter(!is.na(shadow)) |&gt; mutate(region = tolower(region))\n\nNext, I found the number of times groundhogs in each state saw their shadow by grouping by region and using summarise to create the n_shadows variable.\n\ngroundhogs_sum &lt;- groundhogs_pred |&gt; group_by(region) |&gt; summarise(n_shadows = sum(shadow)) \n\nThen, I joined the summarised groundhogs data with the state_df so that I would be able to create a map of the groundhog shadow sightings in the US.\n\nsum_state_groundhog &lt;- right_join(groundhogs_sum, state_df, by = \"region\")\n\n\n\nMap of the Number of Groundhog Sightings in the US between 1887 and 2023\n\nggplot(data = sum_state_groundhog, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = n_shadows)) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"albers\", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"plasma\") + labs(title = \"Number of Groundhog Sightings in the US between 1887 and 2023\", subtitle = \"*states in grey had no groundhog shadow sightings\") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 7))\n\n\n\n\nUsing the maps package as well as the sum_state_groundhog dataset I created, I was able to make the above map. As its title states, the map depicts “The Number of Groundhog Sightings in the US between 1887 and 2023”. One of the first things to stand out in the map, unsurprisingly, is Pennsylvania which is highlighted in yellow as the state with the highest number of shadow sightings. This makes sense because Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is where the main Groundhog Day ceremony is held, so thus, there would be a high number of recordings of Groundhog Day results, leading to a higher number of shadow sightings by default. In addition to Punxsutawney, there are several other small towns in Pennsylvania that participate in the tradition, so there would be a bigger number of recordings and thus shadow sightings.\nInterestingly, it does seem that overall states in the north and northeast particular seem to have a higher number of shadow sightings which relates back to my question of interest. In colder states, groundhogs see their shadows more often, thus predicting a longer winter more frequently.\nHowever, not all northern states have this. In fact many of the states are grey which means that they have no shadow sightings recorded in the dataset. This is interesting because this either means that the states had no Groundhog Day recordings at all or they simply didn’t have shadow sightings.\n\ngroundhogs_lolli &lt;- groundhogs_sum |&gt; mutate(region = fct_reorder(region, n_shadows))\n\nggplot(data = groundhogs_lolli, aes(x = region, y = n_shadows)) + labs(title = \"Number of Groundhog Sightings in the US between 1887 and 2023\") + geom_segment(aes(xend = region, y = 0, yend = n_shadows)) +\n  geom_point() + coord_flip() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 7)) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nAll of this can also be seen in the above lollipop plot, which is a simplified rendition of the same data. The lollipop plot highlights just how insufficient using the number of shadow sightings is for representing the trends in the data. Using only the number of shadow sightings does not give a sense of how common or uncommon a shadow sighting is. Therefore, I made a new dataset with a variable calculating the proportion of shadow sightings in the US. I then used this new dataset to make a new map and lollipop plot using the proportion instead.\n\ngroundhogs_prop &lt;- groundhogs_pred |&gt; group_by(region) |&gt; summarise(prop_shadows = mean(shadow)) \n\nprop_state_groundhog &lt;- right_join(groundhogs_prop, state_df, by = \"region\")\n\nggplot(data = prop_state_groundhog, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = prop_shadows)) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"albers\", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"plasma\") + labs(title = \"Proportion of Groundhog Sightings in the US between 1887 and 2023\", subtitle = \"*states in grey had no groundhog shadow sightings\") +  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 7))\n\n\n\n\nAs predicted, the proportion is a much more effective method at looking at the trends in data in both plots. The map, in particular, clearly exhibits greater variance than the previous map using only the number of shadow sightings. Interestingly, however, instead of Pennsylvania having the highest proportion of sightings, it is California. This is likely because there have been fewer Groundhog Days in California, leaving a smaller sample size to calculate the proportion from, thus making the proportion deceptively high. But as shown in the below lollipop plot as well, the proportion does give a better sense of the variance of the data, which makes it overall more effective for examining the trends in the data.\n\ngroundhogs_lolli_prop &lt;- groundhogs_prop |&gt; mutate(region = fct_reorder(region, prop_shadows))\n\nggplot(data = groundhogs_lolli_prop, aes(x = region, y = prop_shadows)) + labs(title = \"Proportion of Groundhog Sightings in the US between 1887 and 2023\") + geom_segment(aes(xend = region, y = 0, yend = prop_shadows)) +\n  geom_point() + coord_flip() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 7)) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and wrap-up\nOverall, I would say that my primary visualization methods did not necessarily work perfectly to visualize the data. However, the ability to use maps to graph and visualize the data makes it more interesting, and easier to get a sense of the spread of groundhog sightings in the US. I think this can be helpful in cases like this where geographic information is important, especially since with this data in particular I was interested in how the trend in shadows relates to the geographical layout of the US. If I had more time I would be interested in researching the shadow sightings over the course of time. I also think it would be interesting to look at the differences between rural and urban communities groundhog recordings. I also would have liked to be able to categorize states as either north or south to investigate the data.\n\n\nConnection to class ideas\nI used a lot of the ideas we learned in class to visualize the data I was working with. One of the main things I was able to work with was to be able to adjust the specifics of the theme of my graphs to make them easier to read and better to look at. I also used the color scale concept that we learned, using a continuous or sequential scale on both of my maps since both the prop_shadows and n_shadows variables are continuous variables. I would say that my graphs, especially the maps, are an effective way of displaying the trends of data in both the proportion and number of groundhog shadow sightings in the US. The maps are particularly effective because they visualize the data in geographical context. One drawback however is there are many missing values, which makes thr graph less complete. But I would say generally speaking the graphs are an effective means of displaying the data."

    "text": "Introduction\nHollywood films are infamous for their ridiculous casting age gaps in films, which can be amusing at times. I think it could be interesting to see what kind of factors from the films could predict how big the age gap could be.\nOn the TidyTuesday GitHub repo I was able to find a data set called “age_gaps” which contains data about different couples from different Hollywood films. The data set includes, variables, such as the film name, the release year, and the name of both the characters and their actors, along with several other variables. The most important is the “age_difference” variable which provides the age difference of the characters in the film couple.\n\n\nQuestion of interest\nWhat factors in the data set can best predict the age gap of different film couples and how well can it really be predicted?\n\n\nData set links\nage_gaps: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-02-14/age_gaps.csv\n\n\nRead in the data and packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(broom)\nage_gaps &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/age_gaps.csv\"))\n\n\n\nTidying and wrangling the data\nFor this I did not do a ton of tidying but, I wanted to mutate the character_1_gender so it made more sense. On the website, it is explained that character 1 is the older character, I thought that for the purpose of my model it would make more sense to alter the variable so that it is more clear what the variable is. Thus, I changed the variable of character_1_gender to gendergap, which shows the gender of the older character in the age gap.\n\ntidyagegaps &lt;- age_gaps |&gt; mutate(gendergap = if_else(character_1_gender == \"woman\", true = \"older woman\", false = \"older man\")) |&gt; relocate(gendergap) \ntidyagegaps\n\n# A tibble: 1,155 × 14\n   gendergap   movie_name     release_year director age_difference couple_number\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 older woman Harold and Ma…         1971 Hal Ash…             52             1\n 2 older man   Venus                  2006 Roger M…             50             1\n 3 older man   The Quiet Ame…         2002 Phillip…             49             1\n 4 older man   The Big Lebow…         1998 Joel Co…             45             1\n 5 older man   Beginners              2010 Mike Mi…             43             1\n 6 older man   Poison Ivy             1992 Katt Sh…             42             1\n 7 older man   Whatever Works         2009 Woody A…             40             1\n 8 older man   Entrapment             1999 Jon Ami…             39             1\n 9 older man   Husbands and …         1992 Woody A…             38             1\n10 older man   Magnolia               1999 Paul Th…             38             1\n# ℹ 1,145 more rows\n# ℹ 8 more variables: actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   character_1_gender &lt;chr&gt;, character_2_gender &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_birthdate &lt;date&gt;, actor_2_birthdate &lt;date&gt;, actor_1_age &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_2_age &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nInitial Visualizations\nTo get a preliminary examination of the data, I made a few minor graphs just to get a feel for the variables I will use in my model.\n\nggplot(data = tidyagegaps, aes(x = actor_1_age, y = age_difference)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + labs(y = \"Age Difference\", x = \"Older Actor Age\")\n\n\n\n\nThe above scatter plot shows how the age difference increases with the age of the older actor which makes sense as a large age gap is much more common with a much older actor.\n\nggplot(data = tidyagegaps, aes(x = release_year, y = age_difference)) + geom_line() + theme_minimal() + labs(y = \"Age Difference\", x = \"Release Year\")\n\n\n\n\nThis line plot above shows how age difference changes over the course of time, using release_year as the time variable. The graph did not come out very well as the age gap jumps around a lot, making the line plot so “zig zaggy”. With this plot it is challenging to identify a clear trend.\n\nggplot(data = tidyagegaps, aes(x = gendergap, y = age_difference)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal() + labs(y = \"Age Difference\", x = \"Older Character Gender\")\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the above box plot is perhaps the most interesting and most useful of these three variable plots. The plot is showing the difference in the age gap when the man is older vs. when the woman is. Unsurprisingly to me, there is a much bigger range in age differences when the man is older vs. the woman. This is a pattern I had noticed a lot especially, in older movies. It seems to be much more common to cast a much younger woman with an older man, as opposed to if the woman is older, it is more common to cast a man closer or woman closer to her own age.\n\n\nModelling\nTo make my final visualization of the data I created a linear model predicting age_difference based on release_year, actor_1_age (the age of the older actor), the interaction term between release_year and actor_1_age, and lastly, the gendergap variable\n\nmodtidy &lt;- lm(age_difference ~ release_year + actor_1_age + actor_1_age:release_year + gendergap,\n               data = tidyagegaps)\nmodtidy |&gt; tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  term                       estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)              -366.       93.2         -3.93 9.04e- 5\n2 release_year                0.177     0.0466       3.81 1.49e- 4\n3 actor_1_age                13.2       2.13         6.20 8.03e-10\n4 gendergapolder woman       -2.82      0.439       -6.42 1.93e-10\n5 release_year:actor_1_age   -0.00632   0.00106     -5.94 3.82e- 9\n\n\nThe model shows that the y-intercept of the model is negative, with the release_year and actor_1_age coefficients both being positive, but the coefficients of both their interaction term and the gender gap with an older woman are both negative.\nNext, I created a grid of the data, to create an augmented dataset which calculated the confidence intervals for the model.\n\ngridmodtidy &lt;- tidyagegaps |&gt;\n  data_grid(\n    actor_1_age = seq_range(actor_1_age, n = 6),\n    gendergap = c(\"older man\", \"older woman\"),\n    release_year = seq_range(release_year, n = 4)\n  ) \ngridmodtidy\n\n# A tibble: 48 × 3\n   actor_1_age gendergap   release_year\n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        18   older man           1935\n 2        18   older man           1964\n 3        18   older man           1993\n 4        18   older man           2022\n 5        18   older woman         1935\n 6        18   older woman         1964\n 7        18   older woman         1993\n 8        18   older woman         2022\n 9        30.6 older man           1935\n10        30.6 older man           1964\n# ℹ 38 more rows\n\naug_tidy &lt;- augment(modtidy, newdata = gridmodtidy,\n                     interval = \"confidence\")\naug_tidy\n\n# A tibble: 48 × 6\n   actor_1_age gendergap   release_year .fitted .lower .upper\n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        18   older man           1935  -5.85   -9.62  -2.08\n 2        18   older man           1964  -4.01   -6.25  -1.77\n 3        18   older man           1993  -2.17   -3.13  -1.21\n 4        18   older man           2022  -0.327  -1.74   1.08\n 5        18   older woman         1935  -8.67  -12.5   -4.84\n 6        18   older woman         1964  -6.83   -9.15  -4.52\n 7        18   older woman         1993  -4.99   -6.07  -3.91\n 8        18   older woman         2022  -3.15   -4.61  -1.69\n 9        30.6 older man           1935   6.40    4.21   8.59\n10        30.6 older man           1964   5.93    4.64   7.23\n# ℹ 38 more rows\n\n\n\n\nPlot of the model\nFinally, I made a faceted line and scatter plot of the model, using the original data for the scatter plot. But the, augmented data for both the line plot, and the confidence intervals. I faceted the graph by gendergap and treated release_year as a factor, which split it into 4 of its most common values for each line on the graph, since I set n to 4 in the grid, I could not use every year value as it would be too many and overwhelm the graph.\n\nggplot(data = age_gaps, aes(x = actor_1_age, y = age_difference)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + geom_ribbon(data = aug_tidy, aes(y = .fitted, ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper, fill = as.factor(release_year)), alpha = 0.4) + geom_line(data = aug_tidy, aes(x = actor_1_age, y = .fitted, colour = as.factor(release_year)), linewidth = 2) + facet_wrap(~gendergap) + theme_minimal() + labs(colour = \"Release Year\", y = \"Age Difference\", x = \"Older Actor Age\", fill = \"Release Year Confidence Interval\")\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting plot is a bit odd, due to such a negative y-intercept, the entire plot is shifted below zero, which is the main thing altering the graphs appearance so severely. However, there is a clear interaction point in the lines around 30 years for the older actor age. Additionally, it is quite obvious that the age difference increases with age of the older actor. The lines show that, the older movies had much bigger age gaps than the more recent ones which is unsurprising as big age gaps were much more common in older films. Interestingly, the confidence intervals seem to be bigger for the older movies than the newer ones.The lines in both individual plots are parallel which is to be expected. However, the lines in the graph with the older woman are slightly lower than in the one with the older man, this relates to the trend I observed in the side by side box plots. In summary, the conclusion, I can come to using this graph is that the age difference in between actors in films increases with the age of the older actor, and that difference tends to be greater when the man is older. Lastly, the age difference have gradually gone down over time in more recent films, meaning hopefully these big age gaps are a thing of the past.\n\n\nConclusion and wrap-up\nIn conclusion, I feel that this model was a successful method answering my question of interest, of what best predicts the age gap in between actors in films. I found it an interesting and challenging method to answer the question. That being said, there are a couple of important things to note with the data, that most likely impacted my model and had I more time I would have liked to address. One, is that some films are listed multiple times in the data set as they had multiple couples, for me this did not matter a ton because I was just interested in the age gaps not necessarily the films, but if I had more time it would have been better to address this issue. Secondly and more majorly, there is the fact that some couples are not just a man and a woman but could also be two men or two women, I do not feel that my model did a great job accounting for this and I would have liked to do that better. Lastly, I just simply would have liked to tidy the data a bit more, it was a bit challenging to work with but certainly interesting.\n\n\nConnection to class ideas\nEverything, in this post certainly related to something we learned in class, but I feel that the overarching idea of the modelling was the most obvious connection. I based my model very heavily off of the evals example we had done in section 9 in class, using that coding structure for inspiration, and using that to help guide me in interpreting the data."
