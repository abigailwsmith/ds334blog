This is my data visualization blog. I have a series of posts working with different data sets I have found on the Tidy Tuesday repository on GitHub. My personal GitHub account is accessible through the above GitHub icon. In each of my posts, I work with different types of visualizations that I have learned about in my Data334 (Data Visualization) course.
