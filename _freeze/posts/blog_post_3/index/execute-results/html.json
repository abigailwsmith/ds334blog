Wars and natural disasters regularly lead to the displacement of people from their home countries (origin countries). As they are forced to escape to other countries (asylum countries) seeking asylum, those new countries are faced with how to find the means to support the new influx of people which can at times strain their own economies. In many ways, however, refugees can be beneficial to asylum countries, contributing economically and socially to their structure. \n\nOn the tidy tuesday repository, I was able to find a very large data set called the population.csv which contains information about global refugee migration since 2010 collected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Each row in the data set is a year with a particular combination of countries. In each row there is a country of origin variable and an asylum country variable. It is important to note that in the data set there are some countries where the asylum and origin country are the same, this is because of internally displaced people (IDPS). IDPS are people who are refugees within the same country, which is why the origin and asylum country is the same. \n\n# Question of interest\n\nWhich countries accept the most refugees and the least? What is the overall trend in displaced peoples over time? Which are the most common countries of origin?\n\n# Data set link\n\npopualtion.csv:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md\n\n# Read in the data and packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidygraph)\nlibrary(ggraph)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nrefugees_df <- read_csv(here(\"data/population.csv\"))\nrefugees_df\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 64,809 × 16\n    year coo_name   coo   coo_iso coa_name coa   coa_iso refugees asylum_seekers\n   <dbl> <chr>      <chr> <chr>   <chr>    <chr> <chr>      <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1  2010 Afghanist… AFG   AFG     Afghani… AFG   AFG            0              0\n 2  2010 Iran (Isl… IRN   IRN     Afghani… AFG   AFG           30             21\n 3  2010 Iraq       IRQ   IRQ     Afghani… AFG   AFG            6              0\n 4  2010 Pakistan   PAK   PAK     Afghani… AFG   AFG         6398              9\n 5  2010 Egypt      ARE   EGY     Albania  ALB   ALB            5              0\n 6  2010 China      CHI   CHN     Albania  ALB   ALB            6              0\n 7  2010 Palestini… GAZ   PSE     Albania  ALB   ALB            5              0\n 8  2010 Iraq       IRQ   IRQ     Albania  ALB   ALB            5              0\n 9  2010 Serbia an… SRB   SRB     Albania  ALB   ALB           49             20\n10  2010 Türkiye    TUR   TUR     Albania  ALB   ALB            5              0\n# ℹ 64,799 more rows\n# ℹ 7 more variables: returned_refugees <dbl>, idps <dbl>, returned_idps <dbl>,\n#   stateless <dbl>, ooc <dbl>, oip <dbl>, hst <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Tidying and wrangling the data for a network graph\n\nFirst I cleaned the data a bit, getting rid of all the unnecessary variables such as all the code ones and renaming the country of origin and country of asylum variables. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrefugees_clean <- refugees_df |> rename(origin_country = coo_name) |> rename(asylum_country = coa_name) |> select(-coo, -coa, -coo_iso, -coa_iso)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, I pivoted the dataset, creating two new variables, the type of migration the country is listed for, as well as the country's name. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrefugees_long <- refugees_clean |> \n  pivot_longer(c(origin_country, asylum_country),\n               names_to = \"type\",\n               values_to = \"country\") |> relocate(country, type)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen I created a network data frame, renaming the origin and asylum variables as vertex 1 and 2 respectively.

And even though it is hard to interpret, it is still eligible what countries play bigger roles in refugee migration than others, or rather it is easier to distinguish between the smaller countries since they are on the outside, while most of the asylum nations are on the inside. \n\n# Revised network graph\n\nIn an attempt to rectify the issue of such a big and confusing network graph, I tried to make it with a smaller and cleaner data set which only includes combinations where the origin and asylum country are different, meaning there are no internally displaced people. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nno_idps <- refugees_clean |> filter(origin_country != asylum_country) \n\nno_idpslong <- no_idps |> pivot_longer(c(origin_country, asylum_country),\n               names_to = \"type\",\n               values_to = \"country\") |> relocate(country, type)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen I created a network data frame, renaming the origin and asylum variables as vertex 1 and 2 respectively.

This could be the result of a series of reasons, the war in Ukraine for example in 2022 could explain the sharp increase seen in the slope of the plot. Another reason why the number of refugees has increased over time is likely due to the effects of increasing climate change. Climate change has led to an abnormally high number of natural disasters in recent years, displacing even more people. \n\n# Barplots of origin and asylum countries\n\nI made two separate data sets, one with only origin countries and the other with only asylum countries. I then created summarized versions of these data sets to see the number of times each country comes up as an origin and/or asylum country, to show which countries are sending and receiving the most refugees. I also arranged both data sets in order of descending total_displaced and sliced the top 100, this will just make the data sets smaller so that the graphs will not be too over crowded. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\norigin <- totaldisplaced |> filter(type == \"origin_country\") |> filter(country != \"Stateless\" & country != \"Unknown\") |> arrange(desc(total_displaced)) |> slice(1:100)\n\nsum_origin <- origin |>  group_by(country) |> summarise(n = n())\n\nasylum <- totaldisplaced |> filter(type == \"asylum_country\") |> filter(country != \"Stateless\" & country != \"Unknown\") |> arrange(desc(total_displaced)) |> slice(1:100)\n\nsum_asylum <- asylum |> group_by(country) |> summarise(n = n())\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot_origin <- sum_origin |> mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n))\n\nggplot(data = barplot_origin, aes(x = country, y = n)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + labs(y = \"Number of Times as an Origin Country\", title = \"Top 9 Most Common Origin Countries\", subtitle = \"Source: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above barplot shows that the most common origin country is the Syrian Arab Republic, which makes sense since the Syrian Civil War has been ongoing since 2011, causing a lot of refugees to flee. The other countries, such as South Sudan and Afghanistan make sense since they have all been involved in several ongoing conflicts. Interestingly while, Ukraine did make it on this top list, it is far down in the graph. this is because the war started in 2022 which is the last year of the data set meaning that the war was pretty early on when the data was collected. Additionally, Ukraine is a relatively small country so it would by default have less refugees.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbarplot_asylum <- sum_asylum |> mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, n)) \n\nggplot(data = barplot_asylum, aes(x = country, y = n)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_minimal() + labs(y = \"Number of Times as an Asylum Country\", title = \"Top 16 Most Common Asylum Countries\", subtitle = \"Source: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above barplot of the top asylum countries is more surprising than the one of the origin countries, since some of the countries are the same. My theory of this is that often times, refugees go to nearby countries at the very least as an initial step towards safety, regardless of whether or not these countries are in conflict themselves. Turkey makes sense because of its location on the Mediterranean, making it accessible from countries in Africa and the Middle East. Poland makes a lot of sense because it neighbors Ukraine and is thus the first step of safety for many Ukrainian refugees. Germany is also an interesting country to note as they have been well known as one of the European countries that accepts the most refugees. \n\n# Conclusion and wrap-up\n\nIn looking through this data and examining these visualizations I learned a few things. For one thing, refugee migration is even more expansive than I thought. Also having too large a data set can be very challenging to work with. If I had more time I would have liked to sort through the data even more so that the visualizations could be easier to interpret. As I mentioned, it would have been nice to sort the countries into different regions but this could be tedious and susceptible to bias. I think that if I could have found a way to make the network graphs so that they can read from left to right with origin countries on the left and asylum countries on the right it could have been a bit easier to interpret, but I could not find a layout that would fulfill this. \n\nI also would have liked it if the original data set included the countries' population including and excluding the total migration influx. This would be helpful because I feel that it is important to consider per capita when looking at population or migration data. For example, some countries may look like they do not accept a lot of refugees but the reality is that they are already small countries to begin with. Meaning that in reality they are accepting a lot of refugees relative to their population even though it may not seem that way, this can also work vice versa for  large countries. \n\n\n# Connection to class ideas\n\nThe main thing I have worked with in this post that connects to what we learned in class is the network graphs. I used a lot of the code foundation from what we did in class working on these. Additionally, I worked a bit with the idea of ethics in data visualization as refugee migration involves a human rights issue being taken into consideration. I feel that when it comes to refugees and interpreting a lot of these conflicts, it can be easy for bias to get involved in trying to draw conclusions about the data. \n\n\n",
